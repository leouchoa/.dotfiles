# Neovim Configuration

- The coc python extension installed is the [pyright extension](https://github.com/fannheyward/coc-pyright)
  - Notice that to get it to work you must have the python formatters packages installed (autopep8, black, isort, ....)
  - Also I think that the [autocmd](https://github.com/leouchoa/dotfiles/blob/e863e776b043ac7c6485c2ee5dddb21d5eba72e3/.config/nvim/init.vim#L74) helps to make it work.
  - In fact I could only get it to work after I installed and activated a virtual env with all the formatters, with the autocmd command on. Only then it formmated everything correctly.
